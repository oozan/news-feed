## Getting Started ðŸ“°

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser and start developing.

Note: starting up can take a while for all the packages to get downloaded.

## Lint and test

We are utilizing the [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) framework for component testing and E2E (End-To-End, @todo) tests.

### Run validation locally

Optionally you are able to run lint and test in your local node environment with npm.

```
$ npm run lint
$ npm run test
```
