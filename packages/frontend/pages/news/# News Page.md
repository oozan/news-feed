# News Page

This is a React component that fetches news articles from an API and displays them on a web page.

## Installation

To install the dependencies for this project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To use this component, import it into your project and call it like so:

```typescriptreact
import NewsPage from './NewsPage';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <NewsPage />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## How it works

This component uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch news articles from an API when the component is first mounted. The `fetchNews` action creator is used to make the API call, and the `news` reducer is used to store the results of the API call.

The component then uses the `news` state to render a list of news articles. Each news article is rendered as a `<li>` element, with the title of the article as the `<h3>` element and the content of the article as the `<p>` element.

## Code Explanation

### `useEffect` hook

The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch news articles from an API when the component is first mounted. The first argument to the `useEffect` hook is a function that contains the code that should be executed when the component is mounted. The second argument to the `useEffect` hook is an array of dependencies. If any of the dependencies change, the `useEffect` hook will be called again.

In this case, the `useEffect` hook is called with an empty array as the second argument. This means that the `useEffect` hook will only be called once, when the component is first mounted.

### `fetchNews` action creator

The `fetchNews` action creator is used to make the API call to fetch news articles. The `fetchNews` action creator takes no arguments, and it returns an action object that contains the type of action that should be performed.

The `fetchNews` action creator is dispatched by the `useEffect` hook. When the `fetchNews` action creator is dispatched, the `news` reducer is called with the action object.

### `news` reducer

The `news` reducer is used to store the results of the API call. The `news` reducer takes two arguments: the current state of the reducer, and the action object that was dispatched.
